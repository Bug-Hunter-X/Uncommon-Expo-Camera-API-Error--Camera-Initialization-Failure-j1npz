# Uncommon Expo Camera API Error: Camera Initialization Failure

This repository demonstrates a solution to an uncommon error encountered when using the Expo Camera API.  The error typically manifests as a failure to initialize or access the device's camera.  This can stem from permission issues, hardware limitations, or incorrect component implementation.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version with detailed explanations.

## Problem

The primary challenge is identifying the root cause of camera access failure.  The error might not provide a clear indication of the problem. This usually involves silent failure without a helpful error message.

## Solution

The solution focuses on robust error handling and permission management. It involves:

1. Explicitly checking camera permissions before attempting to access the camera.
2. Handling potential errors gracefully with appropriate feedback to the user.
3. Verifying camera availability on the device before initializing the camera component.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app on an appropriate device or emulator.
4. Review the code in `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` to understand the problem and its solution.

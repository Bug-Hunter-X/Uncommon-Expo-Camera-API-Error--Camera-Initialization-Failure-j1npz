This error typically occurs when you're using Expo's `Camera` API and encounter issues with permissions or the camera itself.  The exact error message can vary, but it often involves a failure to access the device's camera.  Debugging this requires systematically checking permissions, ensuring the camera is available, and verifying the correctness of your Camera component implementation.
